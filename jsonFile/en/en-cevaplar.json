Some are prescriptive, some are detail-oriented. All characters are actually playmakers. Everyone is born playmakers, but not everyone can carry this character for a long time. The time to be a playmaker is also related to this. Some acquire this skill at a very young age, Some acquire this feature after a very long time.

They're not very good at belonging, but some are rules and rule makers are good They are the father of the family. The instinct of possession binds them to their families. They fully close their families. They devote their lives to their families even though they can do many jobs.

They are a cheerleader at the stadium, or a head doctor. Sometimes a marketer, sometimes an academic. We can say that all successful managers fall into this category. Sometimes we come across as a child, sometimes an expert. We can't separate them by profession. We can't just divide them by their potential. We can't say that they are the most perfect characters in everything, because most of the time they put their emotions in the background and most of the time they do not enjoy life.

They do not deal with their own setups, they follow the instructions of the quarterback to the letter, they make up for a point where the quarterback is missing. Their feelings of cooperation are at the forefront, but it is not right to call them good or bad. Most of the time when they are on a job They leave their emotions aside and work goal-oriented. To describe them in one word, they are complementary. They always find and bring the missing piece somewhere. Their life passes by completing the deficiencies of others.

The higher their energy, the more they can benefit many people at the same time. That's why their happiness is important. The best way to deal with a vizier is to make him happy. If you make him happy, he It makes you happy too. It's the same for all people, but it wouldn't be wrong to say that queens are more selfless. They are usually stubborn people. They are rarely docile. Their weak point is also their stubbornness. Although they come to the last point in an invention compared to the quarterbacks, they persistently focus on the same subject and cannot come to a conclusion.they may not arrive. The day they give up these features, they turn into playmakers. This is a fine line that applies to all characters. Sometimes what you experience in life transforms you into a completely different person. This transformation is your breaking point. This is where you break down and take on your new character. Only the characters of the meters are punctuated here, so to speak. They are born selfless. And they continue this sacrifice all their lives. Whatever life does to them cannot harm their complementarity. No matter what business they are doing; whether a successful musician, a successful painter or a beloved teacher; they perform their work with the highest performance. Your souls are also works of art."

As we mentioned before, they have a playmaker inside them like every character. they also have high editing skills, but like the queens they choose to be complementary. If we call the queens the right arm of the quarterback, it would be correct to call them the left arm. Their most dangerous feature is their independence. While the whole table can act according to the rules of the quarterback, they suddenly develop better They can progress on a plan. This feature is yours when you go to the same destination. It is not very important for So for the faithful, this feature is not so important. But standalone characters can sometimes turn into a spoiler. All characters contain some parts of each other, because all features belong to humans, but over time, our experiences determine our dominant character or we create our dominant character. Shadows don't have a dominant character, they live whatever character they need to live. For them, they are the only comparison choice, but they are never a prisoner of their choice."
